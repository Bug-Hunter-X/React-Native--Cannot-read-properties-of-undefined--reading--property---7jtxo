This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  It's common in React Native when dealing with asynchronous data fetching where the data hasn't loaded yet, or when working with optional properties from an API response.

```javascript
// Example: Trying to access user.name before the user object is loaded.
const userName = user.name; // Error if user is null or undefined
```
